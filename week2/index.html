            <p>On this screenshot, we can see how Walmart’s Photocenter uses the visual hierarchy to emphasize what is most important and then to lead the user to where they want. The thing that fist catches the eye of the users is the bright red box with yellow text on it. This stands out because of the blue background and show that the price is what this website wants to emphasize. After looking at the price your eyes naturally move down and you see the button prompting you to create your own photo book. </p>

            <p>In this screenshot, we use of the design principle of proximity. Starting with the top of the page we have the logo on the left and opposite of it a help button and a menu button. Having these item together convey that they are connected. The same is true for the “Gey Started” button just underneath the invitation to “bring to life your family history.” Because of how close they are the reader knows that the two are connected which means the user should understand where the button will lead them.</p>

            <p>On this webpage, we see an example of Contrat. The is first seen in the bold white against the dark background. We then see how the bold white text contrast agent the thinner font underneath and above the main title. By adding this contrast to the page it creates interest and draws the eye strat to the title.  </p>
