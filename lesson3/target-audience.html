    <p><strong>Person one: Young entrepreneur</strong><br>
        I am a 28-year-old entrepreneur with big ideas and a strong motivation. I have completed my undergrad business program and am ready to build my start-up. I came to this site to learn more about the benefits of joining a chamber of commerce. I am on a low budget so I mostly use google suits as well as my laptop for most of my needs. I am motivated by my desire to make my start-up become successful. In order to do that I need more information about this chamber of commerce and other local business.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Person two: Professional Business person</strong><br>
        I am a 55-year-old franchise owner with an interest in building a location in Beaumont. I have a BA and a master's in business administration. I have joined several chambers of commerce before and what to see if this one is any good. I normally use my work computer at the office to do research. I want to make sure that my franchise would fit in well Beaumont, maybe even flourish.
